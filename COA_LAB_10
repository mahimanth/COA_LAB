1. (a) Write a program in assembly language to print the numbers from 0 to 9.

ORG 100h               ; Origin for COM file format

; Print numbers from 0 to 9
MOV CX, 10             ; Loop counter set to 10 (for numbers 0 to 9)
MOV AL, 0              ; Start with the number 0

print_loop:
    ; Convert number in AL to ASCII character
    ADD AL, '0'        ; Convert number to ASCII

    ; Print the character
    MOV DL, AL         ; Move the ASCII character to DL
    MOV AH, 02h        ; DOS function 02h: print character
    INT 21h            ; Call DOS interrupt

    ; Prepare for the next iteration
    SUB AL, '0'        ; Convert back to integer
    INC AL             ; Increment the number
    LOOP print_loop     ; Loop until CX is zero

; Terminate the program
MOV AH, 4Ch            ; DOS function 4Ch: terminate program
INT 21h                ; Call DOS interrupt to exit

END                     ; End of program


(b) Write an assembly language program to print the characters from A to Z in reverse order.

ORG 100h               ; Origin for COM file format

; Print characters from 'Z' to 'A'
MOV CX, 26             ; Loop counter set to 26 (for letters A to Z)
MOV AL, 'Z'            ; Start with the character 'Z'

print_loop:
    ; Print the character
    MOV DL, AL         ; Move the character to DL
    MOV AH, 02h        ; DOS function 02h: print character
    INT 21h            ; Call DOS interrupt

    ; Prepare for the next iteration
    DEC AL             ; Move to the previous character
    LOOP print_loop     ; Loop until CX is zero

; Terminate the program
MOV AH, 4Ch            ; DOS function 4Ch: terminate program
INT 21h                ; Call DOS interrupt to exit

END                     ; End of program


Practice set:
(b) Write an assembly language program to print the characters from A to Z.
ORG 100H               ; Start at offset 100H for .COM file format

MOV CX, 26             ; Loop counter for 26 characters (A to Z)
MOV DL, 'A'            ; Start with ASCII code of 'A'

PRINT_LOOP:
    MOV AH, 2          ; Function to print character
    INT 21H            ; Print character in DL

    INC DL             ; Move to the next character (A -> B -> C ...)
    LOOP PRINT_LOOP    ; Repeat until CX reaches 0

MOV AH, 4CH            ; Terminate the program
INT 21H



2. (a) Write a program in assembly language to print the numbers from 0 to 9 in REVERSE ORDER
ORG 100H               ; Start at offset 100H for .COM file format

MOV CX, 10             ; Loop counter for 10 numbers (9 to 0)
MOV DL, '9'            ; Start with ASCII code of '9'

PRINT_LOOP:
    MOV AH, 2          ; Function to print character
    INT 21H            ; Print character in DL

    DEC DL             ; Move to the previous number (9 -> 8 -> 7 ...)
    LOOP PRINT_LOOP    ; Repeat until CX reaches 0

MOV AH, 4CH            ; Terminate the program
INT 21H
